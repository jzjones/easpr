{"name":"Easpr","tagline":"Peering Made Easy","body":"easpr\r\n=====\r\n\r\nEaspr is a project that combines Polymer with WebRTC to create custom collaborative elements. This repository contains the source for the demo site, which can be found [here](http://cs.unc.edu/~ssmith96/easpr/index.html). Below are descriptions of each of these elements:\r\n\r\n<h3>webrtc-element</h3>\r\nThis is the 'base' element that each of the other elements inherit. As such, each of the other elements are dependent upon it. As it's functionality is primarily \"behind the scenes,\" it should not actually be placed on a page; instead, use one of the other elements that extend it.\r\n\r\n<h3>webrtc-container</h3>\r\nThis element is used to contain each of the functional elements: videochat, textchat and map. Simply including this element within a page will add the functionality of the other elements with a complete layout created using Pure CSS.\r\n\r\n<h3>videochat-element</h3>\r\nThis element provides conference call functionality via WebRTC and RTC MultiConnection.\r\n\r\n<h3>textchat-element</h3>\r\nThis element provides peer-to-peer text chat via WebRTC and RTC MultiConnection.\r\n\r\n<h3>map-element</h3>\r\nThis element provides a collaborative map made using Leaflet JS and RTC MultiConnection. Clicking on the map will place a marker that can be seen by others in the session.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<b>For more information</b>, please view our repository for the elements themselves, which can be found [here](https://github.com/andycandrea/easpr-elements).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
